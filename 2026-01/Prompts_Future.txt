We are doing new modifications based on the files we generated by studying OpenConfig and OpenROADM standards. An walkthrough is maintained "Walkthrough.md" and tasks "Tasks.md" are also populated for future references. 

1.  See the current sql file /2025-11/rsa_project/sql/devices.sql:
    -   right now we don't have additional information
    -   in addition to name and type we need "vendor" and "model"
    -   the device name should be read from the xml and stored
    -   the type(is it a transponder or roadm or what) is basically decided by the SDN controller: driver type of explicit flags. So for now we can skip reading information for it from the xml
    -   vendor and model should be read and saved
    -   Reading:
        -   when we send request to the container using ncclient we basically read a xml file that contains the capabilities
        -   but we cannot make things this much complicated now to save time
        -   we are skipping the nccliend and remote calls
        -   a device can have either openconfig or openroadm yang model running inside it
        -   we have reference file with standard XML structure here: 
        -   now we have to design a python script and decide filters to read from the configuration files
        -   The workflow:
            -   DEVICE_TYPE =
