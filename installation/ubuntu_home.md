# Installing in my ubuntu machine(dumb)

I tried installing VM, UbuntuServer 22.04 in my ubuntu laptop. It worked perfectly, and also created a ssh connection so that it can be accessed from the same LAN. See this directory for details of [how to create a ssh server for the vm](../additional-nic/). But before that you must ensure you have openSSH installed in your VM OS. If not you can follow this [process](../ssh-server/).
