let's design a critical skeleton for rsa computation. I want you to read my instructions very carefully and ask questions if you have any! Before starting coding. Here is the current situation:

- I have a path from TPA1:1101 to TPA3:1101
-- in between RDM1 and RDM2

- I have a path from TPA2:1101 to TPA4:1101
-- in between RDM1 and RDM2

- I have a path from TPA5:1101 to TPA6:1101
-- in between RDM1 and RDM2

- the ports of the three transponders TPA1,2,5 are connected to different ports of the RDM1
- also TPA3,4,6 are connected to 3 ports of RDM2

- so we have 3 links

Computation plan: for the = CONSTANT, create constant variables so that later I can put my test values

- requested source device and port id = CONSTANT
- requested destination device and port id = CONSTANT
- take requested slot = CONSTANT 
- take source port id: has c_slot = 34359738368
-- convert it into bitmaps(35 of 1s)
-- log it : use logger
- take source device id and find out other ports
-- N found
--- take their c_slot values and convert into bitmap
--- log them
- perform a Union operation between the bitmaps to find a contiguous block > requested slots
-- print the bitmap( for reserved use 0 and for free 1)
- store it in a variable as usable_slots
- now load the path links from requested source to requested destination
- load all the ports in a variable [[device: , port: , c_slot:]] as path_link_ports(array of arrays)
- log them
- now take usable_slots variable and compare with every values inside path_link_ports  
- if any of the port fails to provide the requested slots, then return False
- else return True

How to implement this?
- create an endpoint /rsa-computation
- create a function rsa_computation in a file rsa.py
- perform the calculation there
- add the function in app.py /rsa-computation endpoint

Topology Generation Prompt:

Now we have the hardest part:
- consider all these devices, endpoints and links part of the same topology
- @test_topo.pdf has the pictorial representation
- do you think it is possible to draw the topology using networkX package?
- for example you can consider each devices as a node
- each link as an edge
- now we have multple connections from one node to another node. In the link we have different ports but in networkX we don't have the concept of ports
- so we take different colors from node to node, as example you can check @topo.py 
- keep all the information of a link using additional variables inside the add_edge function
- because we will need the src_port, dst_port, c_slot, l_slot for further calculations
- use different colors and angles to visualize the links, try bright colors so that it's visible
- generate the topology and create a new file topology.py and remove @topo.py 
- create a function there in topology.py and do everything there
- save it as a picture using matplot 
- then use the app.py file to create an url /topology and display the topology using a new template file topology.html
- remove unused contents from everywhere while you go through
